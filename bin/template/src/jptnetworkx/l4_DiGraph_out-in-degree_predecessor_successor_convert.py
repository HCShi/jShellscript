# Directed graphs; out_edges(), in_degree(), predecessors(), successors(); methods specific to directed edges
# To allow algorithms to work with both classes easily, the directed versions of neighbors() and degree()
# are equivalent to successors() and the sum of in_degree() and out_degree() respectively even though that may feel inconsistent at times.

# Convert
# Indeed the tendency to lump directed and undirected graphs together is dangerous.
# If you want to treat a directed graph as undirected for some measurement you should probably convert it using Graph.to_undirected() or with
H = nx.Graph.to_undirected(DG); print(H.nodes())  # [1, 2, 3]
H = nx.Graph(DG) # convert DG to undirected graph
